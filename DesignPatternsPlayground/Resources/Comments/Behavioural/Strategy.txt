I had fun implementing this pattern! It is straightforward to implement and has invaluable benefit: ability to choose algorithm (or strategy, you name it) on the fly.

The upside of this patter is obvious - it encapsulates the algorithm-related code to the client, plus enables client to choose different algorithm on the fly! Plus, I don't think this pattern got any downside - I might add more later after revisiting this one.
