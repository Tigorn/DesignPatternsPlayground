I really had fun implementing this sample! After a little thought, I choose to implement a mini game instead - a mini game where you will win, of course ðŸ˜‰

The upside of this pattern is obvious - it lets you run through a nested components / tree with same interface / protocol. This alone will simplify a lot of boilerplate code - by using recursion.

The only downside that I know about this pattern is the danger of oversimplifying - which normally happens when we force a problem to fit into a pattern, instead the other way around.
