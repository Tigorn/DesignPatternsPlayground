This pattern is quite straightforward to implement. The sole purpose is pattern is to create a proxy (duh) with same method / API with the real object.

In a glance, this pattern looked similiar with Decorator pattern since they add extra functionality with same API from the real object. The underlying difference is the purpose - while Decorator used to add enhance feature, Proxy used to "represent" the feature of the main object, with extra validation.

On this sample, the Proxy class (ThemeParkTicketSalesPerson) creates its own real object (ThemeParkTicketVendingMachine). In real case implementation, it would be better pass the real object in initializer, and create a Factory class for the Proxy object. This might be beneficial if the real object is a Singleton or takes a lot of resource to make.

The upside of this pattern is obvious. The proxy objects could represent a big / expensive object, while themselves are light / easy to create. Plus, the proxy object could be used to add validation before accessing the main object's method, usually the ones with sensitive information.

I haven't found any downside of this pattern. I might change my mind on the future, though! üòÅ
