#Design Patterns Playground

This project was made as an attempt to learn [GoF's Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) and how to implement it in Swift 2. I might not implement all of them (or at least, the right way), since there's a chance that Swift 2 doesn't have concepts that available in C++ or Smalltalk, which were the main languages of the book. I tried my best to add UI representations on how the patterns are used (instead of just print logs), and comments about the pattern tha accessible from the UI!
